    <h1>INTRODUCTION </h1>
    <p>I work at Soda Animation Studios, an animation &amp; mobile game developer company. We are a team of five people working together. This is why I decided to pursue an education in coding &amp; programming. The best decision ever and I am already loving it!!!</p>
    <p>I am also working at Newark School of the Arts right now.</p>
    <p>Respect for others, commitment &amp; grid for what you stand for in life, are basically the most important things for me. Although according to others loyalty is my strongest asset.</P>

    <h1>I am from the Caribbean.</h1>
    <p>The Caribbean, yes! I love watching sunsets and looking over turquoise waters. Actually, turquoise color really makes me happy. I also love the mountains because the weather is cooler &amp; also because I grew up there. Travelling is second nature to me. Surprisingly enough Scandinavian countries are my favorites.</p>
